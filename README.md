Blogger Website Hero Section
This project is a hero section for a blogger website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The hero section features a visually engaging design with a prominent title, description, and call-to-action button.

This section provides a welcoming introduction to the blog and enhances user engagement.
